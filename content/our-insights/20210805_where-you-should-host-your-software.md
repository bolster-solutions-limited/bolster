Cloud hosting is an increasingly popular choice for hosting software, with many businesses opting for the newer technology in contrast to the more dated on-premises hosting. In this post we’ll outline the pros and cons of each method to help you choose the option that is best for your business.

### What is cloud hosting?

The cloud can be described as a global connection of servers. The cloud can store and analyse your data, run different types of applications, and content such as office software or videos.

Allowing you to save and access things remotely from anywhere with an internet connection.  For more detail on the Cloud read our other blog post how the cloud can help your business.

# What is On-premises Software?

On premises software aka shrink wrap, is the most common type of host software and considered quite traditional, this is because it is installed on the in-house server and computer infrastructure of a business, basically it is located on the premises of the business.


On-premises Pros 
Secure host- On premise software is generally considered to be more secure as it is owned solely by the business and located on the business premises. This would increase the safety of your data and protection from malware and cyber-attacks from external sources.
You own your software- with on-premises software you get total cost ownership since it's a one time payment, this can result in an overall lower total cost in comparison to the cloud software.
Another pro would be having complete control of your software and data meaning you have the ability to change and adapt software to your liking.
On-premises Cons
On Premises software usually has a higher initial cost because it requires an in-house server hardware, investment, software licence and staff to monitor and maintain the software, this all adds up to a significant initial investment.
Maintenance- you are responsible for the maintenance and the upkeep of your system which can be time consuming and costly which we previously mentioned, this may be an issue for small companies that may not have the capital to maintain the high costs that come with on-premises software.
Longer integration periods- installing and updating software will take considerably longer due to having to install the software on servers and each individual computer/laptop.

Cloud Software Pros
Affordable- the cloud software does not require any upfront costs, instead you would pay ongoing costs to use the service, this also makes it easier to budget for your cloud as it is likely that it is the same recurring cost each month.
Low maintenance- The cloud hosts your software for you which means you won’t have to worry about the up-keep costs, and installing updates, and downloading data as it will be done automatically allowing you to focus on more important aspects of your business.
Accessible- You can access your applications and documents at any time and place since the cloud is hosted over the internet, making working all the more convenient.
High level of security- The clouds databases can afford a high level of security which would be out of budget for a smaller business, this ensures that your data is secure
Cloud software Cons
Needs Internet access- In order to use the cloud to host your software you need a solid internet connection to access your applications and documents.
Long-term costs- although the cloud has no initial cost the ongoing payments will start to add up which will result in higher cost expenditure in the long run.
Limited customisation- The cloud is configured to be used by a lot of businesses therefore, you may not be able to customise your software to the liking of your business.
