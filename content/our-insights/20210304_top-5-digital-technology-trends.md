The past year has changed many aspects of our lives and businesses from the way we interact with customers, to the supply chain and more.

The covid-19 pandemic called for a transformation for many businesses and digital technology was at the forefront of this. In this blog post we list the top 5 digital technology trends that are being adopted by businesses in 2021.

### 1. Meshing corporate and technology strategies

Technology has become a source of competitive advantage for businesses, so organisations are now trying to blur the line between corporate and tech strategies. The traditional planning of strategies is thought to be too labour intensive and not fast enough to take advantage of arising opportunities. The new method is to use tech to create new strategies with the use of AI, advanced analytics, and automation. Creating more broadened strategies and agile responses to the changing environment.

### 2. Supply chain transformation

During the pandemic supply chains were met with extremely fluctuating demands of necessities such as hand sanitiser and toilet paper which they could not respond quick enough to. Transforming the supply chain into a more customer focused one by using digital technology and data to further segment customers and predict demands. This is to make supply chains more responsive to unique customer requests and possible variations in demand. 
Trends also suggest making supply chains more efficient and safer with the introduction of robots to increase productivity, drones to measure logistics, and image recognition to ensure a safe environment.

### 3. Cyber security

Zero trust cyber security is intended to tackle the new digital environment and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Conventional security methods are becoming less useful against the evolving cyber-attacks. Many businesses now use third party software to store and manage their data through the cloud which increases the chance of an attack. Zero trust cyber security looks at available data such as location, identity to determine risks, everything is treated on an individual basis to contain risks.

### 4. Artificial Intelligence

AI can help transform business from development to production management, and can result in a more optimised software and delivery.  Machine learning has the potential to increase the value of a business through speeding up product development, testing and production. However, to do so organisations will have to reassess their current structures and culture.

### 5. Combined digital and physical experience

Digital interaction is to be expected along with physical following the pandemic, the customer journey will be a combination of both. Some companies are trying to personalise their digital technology to give it a more human appeal. While others are trying to bring the in-store shopping experience to the customer with virtual reality.

Businesses have had to adapt to the changing environment and digital technology is playing a significant role in assisting them. The trends show a shift to a more optimised and efficient way of conducting business, which trends are you looking to adopt into your business.
