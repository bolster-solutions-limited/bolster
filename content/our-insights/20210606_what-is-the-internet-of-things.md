As technology continues to advance it becomes increasingly integrated allowing for more efficiency and interaction, IoT has become key to the next stages of the digital revolution. The Internet of Things can be added to all industries and sectors, but in this blog post, we will give an example of IoT concerning real estate. In this post, we will define the term Internet of Things, and give 3 examples of how it can be used in business today.
What is [the Internet of Things]?
The simple definition for the Internet of Things is a group of network-enabled devices that communicate with each other through data. The kind of networks used for IoT is Bluetooth, WIFI and NFC connections. An example of the devices would be security systems, smart appliances, and any kind of object with an RFID tag for example a thermostat, a printer, and a bulk package of paper.
How the Internet of Things works
The network-enabled devices use internet protocol to send data and respond to each device, allowing for them to send and uncover important data, data analytics is then applied to create information which is used to create insights and detect new changes in the environment.
Why is [IoT] Important for Business?
The use of the Internet of things can transform the efficiency of a business, as the information it provides allows businesses to make smarter decisions based upon real-time data.  This can help efficiency as it also allows for repetitive tasks to be automated and as a result saving the business more time and money. In 2021 there will be 10 billion active Internet of Things devices. And already 83% of organizations have reported an improvement in their efficiency by introducing Internet of Things technology.

3 Real Examples of Internet of Things
Smart homes
Use for the Internet of things would be smart homes which can use the Internet of Things to provide a wide variety of functions. For example, security for homes, smart lighting, water leak detection, smoke sensors, and monitor windows and doors as well as being notified who enters and exits a home. This allows for a fully automated living experience and would be of good use to a real estate company. As it will allow for higher security at the properties and efficiency in notifying which houses are more popular and any other possible insight.
Building
The Internet of things is also transforming the building sector in many ways, for example managing supply chains and reducing construction waste through the use of RFID sensors to track prefabricated materials through the supply chains. Allowing for coordinated construction and real-time insights to avoid effects of delays and manage progress as well as key performance indicators.
Construction Management
IoT can save time with delays in construction by using sensors to monitor equipment and machinery to detect unusual patterns in temperature and breakdowns. These detections can alert maintenance workers to intervene before a breakdown to save time and costs that would come with buying new construction equipment.
3 Key takeaways from the Internet of Things
The types of network connections can include WIFI, Bluetooth and NFC
Network enabled devices exclude any kind of computer, laptop, or server
Internet of things devices are smart i.e., home security, thermometers, speakers, wearable devices, anything with an RFID



Closing
So, to summarise, the internet of things is an aggregated collection of networks that can transform your business and way of life, allowing for better communication of data, automating, and controlling equipment providing your business with efficiency and better satisfaction of customers.
